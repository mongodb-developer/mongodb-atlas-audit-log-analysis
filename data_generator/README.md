# Data Generator

If you don't want to test this toolkit on your own data then you can use this generator that will generate insert/update/deletes operation on the collections `customers` and `orders` in the `audit_logs` database. Therefore you can visualize the audit data in Charts. 

If you are planning to use this script, make sure connection information was set properly (username/password and host information).
